# Arduino_SimonSays
My first Arduino - Uno project! I made this from scratch while learning how to use my aunt's Arduino, on vacation in Italy. This is a simple electronic game that consists of four colored diodes and four corresponding buttons (based on an electronic chilchood game of a similar nature, that we had at home). It is a memory game where the diodes blink in a random order (and play a corresponding buzz, from the piezo), and the player has to recite the same pattern. There are four difficulty levels, each one increasing the length of the pattern/sequence, from 5 (red, easiest) to 20 (blue, hardest). There is also a reset button to return to the difficulty selection state at any point in the game (dead, playing, won).
