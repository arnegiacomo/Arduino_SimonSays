My first Arduino - Uno project! I made this from scratch while learning how to use my aunt's Arduino, on vacation in Italy. This is a simple electronic game that consists of four colored diodes and four corresponding buttons (based on a chilchood game we had at home, with a similar nature). It is a memory game where the diodes blink in a random order (and play a corresponding buzz, from the piezo), and the player has to recite the same pattern. There are four difficulty levels, each one increasing the length of the pattern/sequence, from 10 (red, easiest) to 40 (blue, hardest). I have yet to beat any other difficulty than 10 (red). There is also a reset button to return to the difficulty selection state at any point in the game (dead, playing, won).
